"""#112: a fresh state volume must be writable by the receiver's uid 1000.

Docker seeds a new, empty named volume from the image's directory at the
mount point, ownership included. The image used to declare VOLUME before the
directory existed, so the mount point came up root:root 755 and both
receivers crash-looped on `unable to open database file`. Static checks only:
no Docker in this checkout or CI.
